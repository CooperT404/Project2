Project:

This project uses the base server as a starting point for the rest of the Dungeon Crawler

dice_gold_tools.py
    this file is to create gold and roll dice upon defeating and attacking the enemy respectfully.
    this tool uses random number generators to create  numbers between 10 and 100 for gold, and 1 and 20 for dice_gold_tools
    the gold is awarded after defeating an enemy.
    the dice are rolled during combat

Fighting.py 
    this tool is the core of the combat system; the player will be given a choice between attacking, defending, fleeing, and talking.
    attacking will use the dice roll to determine damage between 1 to 20.
    defending will prevent damage for that turn.
    fleeing will allow the player to escape an encounter but they will have to face another monster later on; they also have a chance of failing the fleeing attempt
    talking will use the dm_ai_tool.py to communicate with the monster.

    the enemy will also be able to attack and defend.
    the enemy will randomly choose either defend or attack; with a priority to defend as health lowers.

    after the battle gold will be awarded.

dm_ai_tool.py   
    this uses a rag network along with the server system to create text responses for the player.
    the reason it uses a server would be so that other people would join: (Not implimented - stretch goal)
    the ai used is deepseek-r1:1.5b, i used this one so that i could have rag implimented when talking with the player; giving the enemies a more dynamic dialouge

dndnetwork.py   
    this is the server starter i used for this project.
    i modified it so that it would be turn based.

Project_Main.py 
    this is the main file that will be used to call all the other ones.
    part of this file was given to us, however i modified it for solo player currently.
    currently once you join the player will be prompted to type /combat to start the fight or /quit to end the program.
